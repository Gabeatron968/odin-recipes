    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onions in the hot pan until beef is browned and crumbly and onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain off fat.</li>
        <li>Drain liquid from canned tomatoes into a 4-cup liquid measure; add water if needed, to make 2 1/2 cups liquid. Add juice, tomatoes, macaroni, corn, bell pepper, garlic, soy sauce, chili powder, Italian seasoning, and pepper to the beef mixture; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the beef mixture into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle 1 cup cheese over top. Repeat beef and cheese layers once more. Cover the dish and place it onto a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    Safety Notes: Ensure the casserole reaches an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C) to ensure it is safe to eat.
